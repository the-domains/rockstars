# The Future of Jobs.

## Employment, Skills and Workforce Strategy for the Fourth Industrial Revolution

World Economic Forum, January 2016

"The _[Future of Jobs Report ][0]_is a first step in becoming specific about the changes at hand. It taps into the knowledge of those who are best placed to observe the dynamics of workforces---Chief Human Resources and Strategy Officers---by asking them what the current shifts mean, specifically for employment, skills and recruitment across industries and geographies. In particular, we have introduced a new measure---skills stability---to quantify the degree of skills disruption within an occupation, a job family or an entire industry. We have also been able to provide an outlook on the gender dynamics of the changes underway, a key element in understanding how the benefits and burdens of the Fourth Industrial Revolution will be distributed."

Richard Samans, Member of the Managing Board.
