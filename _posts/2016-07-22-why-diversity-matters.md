      Diversity is central to Facebook's mission of creating a more open and
      connected world. To reflect the diversity of the 1.4 billion people using
      our products, we need to have people with different backgrounds, races,
      genders and points of view working at Facebook.

  workforces perform better financially. We know intuitively that diversity
  matters. It's also increasingly clear that it makes sense in purely business

  or racial and ethnic diversity are more likely to have financial returns above
  their national industry medians.
